## LazyCurl
A PHP class which brings back @-prefix usage in CURL requests to live, even in PHP 7.

## About
The PHP CURL library is an extremely powerful tool supporting a wide range of protocols. Yet it may be too powerful that there are over 140 customizable options and some of them are affecting one another. Lazycurl is developed to provide an easy-to-use interface for most HTTP requests.

The @-prefix usage in PHP CURL was once a handy method for uploading file in HTTP POST requests. It was deprecated as of PHP 5.5 for various reasons. Lazycurl provides a secure approach in using @-prefix and extends its capability from local file to HTTP URL.
